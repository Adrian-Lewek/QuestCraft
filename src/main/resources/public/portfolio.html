					 <h2>Bias In Tech Research Paper</h2>
					 <p>In my bias in tech paper i researched biases in googles and other search engines algorimths. A bias in technology creates unfair divides between people, based on a rule that technology follows. Often created intentionally by humans. in my research i found that bias in search algorithms, can shield people from info, make assumptions or only show people things based on a artificial group they are put in. One of the biggest biases in search algorithms, is googles promoted answer. lots of times these textboxes you see are just a algorithm deciding if thats what you want to hear, not necesarly a correct answer.</p>

					 <p>Through out my digital art project i worked on making small but complex shapes, as i got better at illustrator i was able to better create my hobbies into art form;</p>
<ol>
<li>Trees: every summer I go to a one-week overnight summer camp, it's called wildcraft, and in the camp we get to make tons of cool things with nature. We get to make bow drill kits to make fire, pine needle baskets, fire engraving, gourd bowls and tons of other things. I think trees are a big part of nature and this camp so that’s how I showed them in my art.​</li>

<li>Music: my two musical instruments are clarinet and the alto sax. When I was in 5th grade I wanted to join band and my dad had played the clarinet, so I decided to play the clarinet. When I was in 6th grade I joined Jr. Jazz and found it fun, eventually we got a Saxaphone. At first, I was skeptical and didn’t want to try it, but soon I got pretty good at it and now it's all I'm playing in jazz.​</li>

<li>Sports: ever since 3rd grade I have played ultimate, my parents signed me up, and it was the first sport I ever played. Last year I tried out for an elite team and I made it! It was fun and its completely changed how I play ultimate. I also play ice hockey, while we were in Winthrop, we went to a small pond, and then some person grabbed some hockey sticks and we started a tiny game, I didn’t really know how to skate, but it was still fun! The next year I joined an actual team and had lots of fun! In 6th grade I made a semi elite team, and this year I am a center, and having lots of fun!​</li>

<li>Sushi: I've never really like sushi, but in 5th grade we went to Hawaii for mid-winter break, and we ate sushi at a place called miso phat. I got a tempura roll and it was the best thing ever, ever since then I've loved sushi and been completely obsessed with it, not we even make some at home!​</li>

<li>Computer/the river thing: I have always enjoyed using computers, and I especially enjoy creating! In 4th grade I started playing Roblox, and after a month or two I asked, "how do people make these games?" Eventualy I found out about Roblox studio. At first, I just made shapes and explored templates, but then I got into the coding aspect of it. Roblox studio is in Lua and I was able to learn my first coding language in about a month or two! I have released one game called escape the pirate ship which is a parkour game, and I've made about a dollar off it! After that I got into Minecraft, and after leaving a server with really racist and sexist users I made my own server, soon I decided I wanted to create plugins to I researched and found that you can do it in java, I had a lot of help from my dad, but I soon made a SwearBlocker for Minecraft chat. And now I'm working on a chat translator. So I guess the river and computer represent how I love computers/automation but how it can also be bad for the environment.</li>

					 <h2>Html/CSS/JS Website</h2>
					 <p>In 5th Grade i first took a html class, i really enjoyed it but never did it again. At the begginning of this year, I took a code Academy html class. After finishing it i took a CSS course, and after that a course on JS. in this website i have included all of these aspects, my image slider on index.html and my signing in process that in still uncomplete. i also have worked really hard with CSS to get the page to be laid out correctly and scale.</p>
					 <p>This Website is about my minecraft server, questcraft. It started in early July it haas been extremely fun to make and play in with friends and strangers who find it online. in a month i hope this website to be completely finished! including games, rewards in game, and accounts verification/handling</p>
